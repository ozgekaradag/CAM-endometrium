# CAM-endometrium
Comparison of CAM based methods on endometrium data
This project aims to compare three of the CAM based methods on the endometrium data.
GradCAM, GradCAM++ and ScoreCAM are compared.
The dataset used is from the paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31581102/
and is available at: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_histopathological_image_dataset_for_endometrial_disease_diagnosis/7306361/2

Commented lines can be revised to create the dataset files and training .h5 files.
